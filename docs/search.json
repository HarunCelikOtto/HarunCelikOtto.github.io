Do you wish that modern day machine learning algorithms could help in referencing your maps into geotiff files? Look no further! The GeoRfrncr is a package that will hopefully help automate the process of georeferencing scans of historical maps. The goal is to help assist the process of georeferencing so more time is instead spent on the spatial analysis of the digitized maps."

The purpose of the CaRtepackage is to aid the digitization process post-georeferencing. By testing different learning algorithms, the goal is to try and find a way to train models that can recognize the common elements of historical maps across a specific range of time. As long as some classification of categories is possible with the potential for easy editing, the tool will have served its initial purpose."

The primary goal of this package is to extract tabular data used in scholarly printed books from the 1970s onward. The goal is to help humanists access tabular data that are common in print publications that have not been digitized."
