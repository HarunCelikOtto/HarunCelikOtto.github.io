To fix this, a potential solution is to run the classifier on the complete raster and to set the processing output to the desired clipped area like the one we have here with Buchanan, Iowa. Doing this ensures that classifications are established based on features from the complete map raster and assigned across any selected area. Otherwise the classifier may fail to classify objects which are less common in other parts of the raster.\nWe can see a discernible difference if we run the classification on the whole raster and set the processing extent on Buchanan, Iowa rather on only running on the clipped area.\nLet’s fist load our libraries\n\nlibrary(aRcGeo)\nlibrary(arcgisbinding)\nlibrary(reticulate)\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWe will first establish paths to our raster files like last time.

This isn’t an ideal classification output if we intend to run any spatial tests on the three separate postal routes.\n\nbrick(Buchanan_Postal_Route_tif) %>%\n  plotRGB()\n\n\n\n\nAnother concern are the classified background patches of the map which we can see in a lighter color in the former example and in dark green in the latter one. While we might be able to ignore them by removing their classifications in a GIS program, increasing the number of desired classifications will only continue to mix parts of the background with features we would like to identify independently which is an obvious larger concern.\nOur test with the five classifications above partially verifies this. As we returned a higher class count, we didn’t necessarily get the features we wanted but rather features on the map that were closer as a class mathematically. The classifier found that background spots were closer together in pixel value than red colored routes. That’s why we only have two postal routes uniquley identified but even more of the background appearing as additional classes.\nAt this point, we can turn to working on processing the original image so that we are able to get a better classification for our purposes."

We can see quite a difference when we overlay the previous classification with the new stretched one.\n\n\n\nDifference in Classification from Original to Stretch\n\n\nHere is the stretched classification in closer detail. Our goal of removing the background patterns has worked relatively well with a lesser portion of the darker blemishes making their appearance as a class. Another success is that we are getting an additional classification for the different postal routes though the classification is still not entirely accurate. The red and blue routes from our original map are mixed in a single classification. Perhaps requesting a higher classification output could help with that but unfortunately, the classifier only finds 5 different classes with the stretched map.\nOur solution may be to take a step back and process the image further.\n\n\n\nClassification on Buchanan Stretch"

Stretching the image further potentially risks losing features on the map that are not as boldly drawn. The county lines or creek features which thin out are good examples of the information we may accidentally remove with more stretching.\nUsing our stretched image, we have the option to use an image segmentation model to segment features on the map based on the adjustment of average pixel values in an area to their closest values. The output of a high spatial and low spectral segmentation model looks like this.\n\n\n\nSegmented Buchanan Raster\n\n\nSome advantages of the segmentation is that we are able to get rid of a significant portion of the background pieces of the map. This even includes the stitching that we could see in the original and previous classified images. Our features are segmented well but it is at the cost of reducing the legibility of the textual features on the map. The trade-off is one that has to be considered if those particular features are desired features to be digitized from the map.\nIf we are happy with the result we can run a classification on this model and see how that performs.\n\n\n\nSegmented Classification on Buchanan\n\n\nIn the classification output above, I’ve removed a lot of the background classifications so we can see the underlying tile map. There are major improvements. All unique postal features are classified properly and we have almost none of the blemishes from the background of the map bleeding into the features.\nWe are still working with color values and its normal for the classifier to confuse colors that are on the edges of our features, since they have different values to the inner pixels. It may be a little difficult to see but some of the the Segmented Classification map features are surrounded by the red classification. This isn’t a major complication but it will be something we need to work on in order to get better features extracted for when we want to conduct our spatial analysis. This is something I will be touching on in the following blog.\nFor now, let’s look at the fruits of our labor by adding a layer containing all current rail line features provided by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) (updated last on November 22, 2022) and see how it compares to the lines of our historical map.\n\n\n\nClassified Buchanan with Current Railroads\n\n\nWe can see just from this example we’ve been working on that the lower rail line currently operated by the Canadian National Railways is probably the same rail track documented in our historical map. The Iowa Northern Railway moving northeast and southwest however is not represented in our historical map. Interestingly, we see that there is a northern line on the historical map which doesn’t correspond to any current rail line that the Iowa DOT data provides. With the information that our map documents rail lines pre-1879, we can answer some interesting questions about the development of railways in Iowa.\nThere are reasons as to why the rail lines don’t exactly overlap with one another but I will also dedicate a blog in explaining how we can overcome differences like this so that we can conduct our historical and spatial analysis.\nTO BE CONTINUED"

This is the assumption because modules like arcgis and other non-licensing required modules can be imported successfully. To be able to check out the license for ArcGIS in R, we will need to have the R-ArcGIS bridge installed.\nOnce r-bridge is installed and a directory is set within the geoprocessing options of ArcGIS we can call the library for arcgisbinding to use the function arc.check_product().\n\nlibrary(arcgisbinding)\n\n*** Please call arc.check_product() to define a desktop license.\n\narc.check_product()\n\nproduct: ArcGIS Pro (13.1.0.41833)\nlicense: Advanced\nversion: 1.0.1.300 \n\n\nIf the function runs successfully, then the connection to ArcGIS has been initialized and licensing has been established. We can additionally check the license by storing arc.check_product() in a variable and calling $license on it.\n\ninfo <- arc.check_product()\n\ninfo$license\n\n[1] \"Advanced\""

If you use ArcGIS Pro, you will need to clone the original environment in order to use arcpy functionality. Like the original, the clone is a conda environment that one should be able to access. There are two ways we can tell reticulate to use this cloned environment.\n\nSetting a Global Option\nThe first option is to set a global python interpreter inside of RStudio. This can be done quite easily through the Tools > Global Options > Python > Select > Conda settings. Once you’ve selected the right environment, your python scripts should run from the python executable in that environment.\n\n\nUsing use_condaenv()\nAnother way is to call the use_condaenv() function to establish the path to the python executable file.\n\nlibrary(reticulate)\n\nuse_condaenv(\"../conda/env/arcgispro-py3-clone/python.exe\",\n             required = TRUE)\n\n# The first argument is the path\n# The second argument ensures that you get an error if \n# that python.exe file doesn't exist\n\nYou can verify that you are using the right environment by running;\n\npy_config()"
